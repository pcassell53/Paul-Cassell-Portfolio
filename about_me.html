                        is Paul Cassell (Castle). I am a freelance UX Designer and a Data Analyst professionally. I am a
                        research focused working professional that has a passion for design. I currently work full-time
                        for DealerOn, a car dealership website provider. My current position is research focused, but my
                        freelance services combine those skills I have learned to design quality products. I graduated
                        from West Virginia University in 2015 with a Bachelor of Arts. I worked on some internships and
                        a job working the front desk at a hotel before I was hired at DealerOn. When I was hired, I was
                        assigned to research and audit API products for a data feed provider. Once I completed the
                        project, I was assigned to work for the Technology and Business Operations department (where I
                        still currently work). I have a more detailed explanation of my projects and work over the past
                        couple of years at DealerOn <a href="Paul Cassell Background.pdf" id="backgroundLink">here</a>. <br>While I was working on these projects during the day, I
                        would teach myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript through courses online in my spare time. This led
                        to my interest in web design. I spoke to a front-end developer about some personal projects I
                        had been working on and he stressed that my interests seemed to be more design focused. I did
                        some reading and found that I had more of a passion for research-based design because of my
                        natural skill set. Since then I have been working on personal projects and some freelance work
                        to improve my UX Design skills.</div>

                    <div id="aboutMePersonal">Personal</div>
                    <div class="aboutMeText">I have a high interest in design, but some of my other hobbies include
                        watching too many
                        movies, playing video games, long-distance running, hanging out with my cat, and playing guitar.
                        I really enjoy spending time with friends (like everyone else), but I also like to have time to
                        myself too. I also like to re-design logos of sports teams and some companies that I think could
                        use an update on their branding. It is a little difficult to not let design creep into some of
                        my daily hobbies since it is something that I am naturally interested in. Regardless, I think
                        that my personality is quite easy going and team oriented. I have confidence in my ability to
                        adapt and contribute positive outcomes to any UX/UI Design team.</div>
