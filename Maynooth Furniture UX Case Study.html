                        <div class="aboutMeText">Before I go into this UX case study, I want to be clear that this was a
                            project that I carried
                            out in my spare time through a course on the website Udemy. The specific course is: User
                            Experience Design Essentials - Adobe XD UI UX Design. The course covers the basics of the User
                            Experience process. It also teaches you how to use Adobe XD as a UI design and prototyping tool.
                            There are two different projects involved in the course that the students partake in. This
                            project is self-guided, but the course as well as the materials provided gave assistance when
                            needed throughout the project’s timeline. Those materials are a project brief and a persona

                            Even though I had been given the needs of the project right off the bat in the brief, I still
                            needed to teach myself how to use the Adobe XD. The project took me through a basic
                            understanding of how to use it. Since I have used the Adobe Suite products (specifically
                            Illustrator and Photoshop) it came to me a bit faster than normal. I also had taken courses on
                            front end development languages which also helped me understand how to lay out my pages. This
                            led me to my research on this project.

                        <div class="aboutMeText">Now the course had led me down a path of creating mid-fi wireframes,
                            prototyping, picking
                            fonts, picking colors, optionally customizing the given logo for Maynooth, creating a mood
                            board, and creating a full color desktop mock-up. I was feeling confident in my ability to use
                            Adobe XD and I was interested to see what someone would think of the mockups on the message
                            board sections of the course. I posted my links and waited. Other than the occasional “Great!”
                            from someone, I received little to no constructive criticism. I decided to not stop there. I
                            currently work for a webhosting company, so I decided to reach out to our UX/UI Design
                            department. I spoke to two separate designers. They were both helpful in the sense of answering
                            my questions about the field. But one was willing to meet with me via Zoom to answer some
                            questions I had and give me some advice on my designs. Shako met with me two times after our
                            original meeting and stressed to me that UX Design is very research based. The problem he saw
                            with my designs was that I was not thinking the way that my persona would. He suggested I that
                            investigate psychography and its place in UX Design. He also suggested that I make at least
                            three versions of the mid-fi wireframe navigation bar. I did my research on psychography and
                            understood that to improve qualitative data in my design I would need to find someone who fit
                        the bill for the persona.</div>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">I found that my Mom fit the bill quite well. Not perfectly, but she was a
                            great source of
                            information to refer to when I began my second and third drafts for the desktop mockups. I also
                        sat down with her for some A/B testing too.</div>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">For the initial mid-fi wireframes, I was primarily researching the listed
                            competitors in the
                            brief. But after I had spoken to Shako, he stressed performing more research on other websites
                            that targeted the persona’s demographic. I then made a list of websites that I could use as a

                            Nordstrom’s navigation bar was primarily inspiring for my mid-fi wireframe drafts. I felt that
                            the least cluttered and straightforward navigation bar would be an improvement over the
                            cluttered nav bars of the competition in the brief. After I had created multiple drafts of the
                            nav bar, I felt it would make more sense to move on to the color drafts and customize the
                            layouts. I created multiple drafts of the layouts of the home and product listing pages.

                        <h3>A/B Test with Real Life User Profiles</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">After I had created at least three drafts of the required pages, I decided
                            to A/B test with my
                            Mom. I let her click through the prototype. I wanted to see what parts of it jumped out to her.
                            She complimented the navbar at first. She liked that it was not cramped with information. She
                            did not have a lot to say about the homepage, the contact page, or the product detail page. But
                            she did have a lot of good feedback on the product listing page. While she could understand the
                            information being presented, she preferred the titles be at the top of each product. The first
                            piece of information she wanted to see was what the product was called as opposed to the product
                            itself. She explained that this would help her remember it in case she forgot to favorite it. It
                            also helped her differentiate between the products when the title is above the picture. She then
                            commented on the filtering options. She preferred the sidebar as opposed to the buttons with
                            dropdown options at the top, surprisingly. The reasoning was “that it looks better”. My
                            assumption was because it was left aligned and due to its size, it was not very distracting, but
                            it is big enough to draw attention. She preferred the text in the product listing to be center
                            aligned along with the color options. This was most of the information I gathered in my notes
                        for that A/B test. </div>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">While I felt somewhat fulfilled, I thought it would be a good idea to test
                            with at least two
                            more people. The problem was that I did not know a lot of people that would fit the user profile
                            perfectly. I instead thought it would be a good idea to test with some female friends of mine to
                            see what they thought to get a slightly different perspective on the mockups. Now my friends did
                            not fit the age or income bracket of user profile, but I felt that they could understand what I
                            was presenting to them and give me some good feedback. I invited them over to my apartment and
                            sat them down to look at my prototypes. They were not too focused in on the home page, but they
                            were having trouble understanding the buttons on it. This I chalked up to creating some
                            improvements on the hero sliders on the top and bottom of the page. I showed them the three
                            different search filter options on the product detail page and asked which they would prefer.
                            One preferred the sidebar option (the same option my mom preferred) and the other preferred the
                            button style fixed sub navbar option. She liked that option because she was used to the filters
                            being at the top of the page when searching for items on an e-commerce site. This gave me a good
                            solution to the filtering option on the page since the side bar now outweighed the top filters
                        two to one. </div>

                        <h3>Creating the Mid-Fi Wireframes and Full Color Mockups</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">When I first started the course there was no emphasis on lo-fi, sketched
                            wireframes of the
                            pages that were being asked to be designed. Instead, I jumped right into mid-fi wireframing in
                            Adobe XD. This got my feet wet using the software, but I would normally start out with some
                            sketches first and then move on to a design software. After I had shown Shako my mid-fi
                            wireframes, he suggested I go back to the drawing board and make at least three different nave
                            bars based on my research. I made three drafts of the nav bars based on the listed websites that
                            I thought had the least cramped and was the most functional. I wanted to create one that was
                            clear and easy to understand as opposed to the competition. Once I had created the three drafts,
                            I decided to stick with one to continue with the full color mockups. I created three drafts for
                        the home page and the product listing page of the full color mockups too.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">The main goal I had for this was to keep it from being too cluttered. I
                            found two recurring
                            designs while I was performing research on other e-commerce sites. First, they seemed to be
                            overly complicated and second the search option was often centered. My solution was to have a
                            right centered search bar that is hover activated. To clear some of the common clutter, I made
                            the account link a dropdown with the idea that encouraged creating an account with the option of
                            a favorites list still available to guest users, but that information is cleared if an account
                            is not created. Finally, I included a cart item and a sub-nav with all the item categories of
                        the website.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Footer</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">I left the footer to be very plain and nondescriptive. It does not deviate
                            far from the norm
                        because I received little to no feedback on it. </div>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Home Page</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">The home page consists of what is asked in the brief with a couple more
                            sections. Starting with
                            the hero slider I thought it would make the most sense to begin with a straight to the point
                            call to action to bring the user into a section of the website. Within the slider is a further
                            explanation of the living room essentials: sofas and armchairs with a button to lead to the
                            product listing page. Immediately after the slider is the clearance deals section starting with
                            the sofas and armchairs deal again. The other sections of the site follow with the other
                            clearance deals to the right of it with higher percentages. I tried to follow the Gutenberg
                            principle after the user scans from the hero slider down to the clearance deals. I repeated this
                            idea with the simple graphic in the middle of the page and followed it up with a new in store
                            section. Finally, I included a social media section at the bottom of the page with a Pinterest
                        logo due to our persona’s preferences.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Product Listing Page</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">I found that the feedback I received after A/B testing was primarily
                            focused on this page. When
                            I first made the initial drafts, I provided multiple filtering options. I also had a couple
                            different alignments for the text and the product information. The most important pieces of
                            information I received after testing was the preferred filtering option and product information
                        layout.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Product Listing Cards</h4>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">The user was focused first on the pictures, but then they wanted to know
                            the product titles
                            second not the price. They also had trouble differentiating the products from each other since
                            there were no boundaries between them in the drafts. I fixed this by adding a subtle box shadow
                            around each product card and presenting the title of the products directly above the pictures.
                            After the product picture, I have the color options before the price based on the user’s focus
                            being the product themselves. Finally, I have a link out to the product details page’s review
                            section at the bottom of each card in the star ratings. Following through with the user’s
                        affection for creating Pinterest boards, I have a favorites option in each card as well. </div>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Filtering Options</h4>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">The favorite filtering option was the sidebar. The reasoning behind this
                            was originally “just
                            because I like it”, but I suspect that the Gutenberg principle can be applied here as well since
                            the sidebar was left aligned. I gave it a fixed position for a better view when scrolling
                            through the products and I left the product listing at three per row to give a better view of
                        the products too. </div>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Favorites Page</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">I added a favorites option since most e-commerce websites have a wish list.
                            I wanted to have
                            something closer to the website Asos technically, but not aesthetically. I liked their
                            simplistic system and I thought it work for this project. You click the heart icon, it fills,
                            and the item is added to your wish list. It is basically the exact same page as the product
                            details page except some different filtering options. An idea that I thought would add to the
                            user’s preferences when it came to Pinterest boards was an alternate view for the favorites
                            list. This view would use the alternate pictures available from the product details page and
                        list them in a tile style.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Product Details Page</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">The first section has alternate images of the product in a hero slider and
                            the main product
                            information to the right of it. The product title and price are the largest pieces of that
                            column. They are followed by an anchor link to reviews section below. I found after testing and
                            research that if the user is going to this page to begin with, they are going to want to find
                            out as much information on the item as possible. So, I thought that an anchor to the reviews
                            section would bring them to the bottom of the page and force them to scroll up past the product
                            details section with collapsible portions. This would encourage the user to collect information
                            before they add the item to their cart. I also thought I would add some comical reviews to it
                            too. After the reviews anchor, I have a short blurb in lorem ipsum beneath it, the color
                        options, and then the add to cart button.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Contact Page</h3>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">I wanted to go with a separate contact page as opposed to the other options
                            of a contact form
                            such as a modal that comes into the foreground while the home page is in the background because
                            after testing, I thought it would be best. While my user profile brief might not have a
                            preference, I understood the psychography of who I tested with and knew that a separate page was
                            the best option. I understand that it might be quicker to have the modal option, but with the
                            separate page it takes out some possibility of the user being overwhelmed with what is happening
                            on the page and provides familiarity with the header and footer being able to be clearly seen.
                            It is also slightly easier to input information. I also created the cat graphic to add a little
                        style to the page and eliminate white space.</div>

                            of the course. I
                            provided each page with every requirement. I even went the extra mile and added a few more pages
                        to add more depth in the end.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Positives</h4>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">I think some of the positive aspects of this project were that it helped me
                            understand the UX
                            process better. It helped me understand how to use Adobe XD and create UI design mockups that I
                            could use in my portfolio. One of the most important parts of this project was that it spurred
                            my interest in learning more about this field. I wanted to research and learn from my mistakes,
                            so I could get better. And this project provided me a no risk scenario to test out what I could
                        do in using these tools.</div>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Growth Points</h4>
                        <div class="aboutMeText">Some areas in this specific project that I felt I could have improved upon
                            were prototyping and
                            testing. Testing being the more important and uncontrollable. There were many parts of the UX
                            process that I missed in this project, but I still understand their importance. Such as working
                            one on one with a user and a developer. I never underestimated the importance of a report with
                            those contributors to the process and I understood that working on a course like this would not
                            hit every part of it completely. I only tested with three people because I could not find many
                            willing to contribute their feedback in the middle of a global pandemic (I started this project
                            in 2020). When I spoke to Shako and researched testing online, the minimum number of users
                            tested is normally five. I did not quite hit that mark. But if this were a project that was
                            fully fleshed out, I would have made a point to do that. Prototyping was not the greatest since
                            I was not too focused on the moving parts as opposed to the designs themselves. I felt that
                            there some parts of the designs that would have looked a bit better with some animations such as
                            the filter sidebar on the Product Listing Page. I thought that making it collapsible would have
                            been interesting. Overall, I am somewhat happy with the design, but I would like to work on more
                            boundary pushing designs or projects with younger user profiles.
                            There is always room to improve and make every design better. But I am confident that I
                            delivered a product that met the user’s needs for an e-commerce website.
