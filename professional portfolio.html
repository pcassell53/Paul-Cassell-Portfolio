                <h1><strong>Beginnings</strong></h1>
                <hr>
                <p>My journey into the world of web development began shortly after I graduated from West Virginia University in 2015. Initially, I embarked on a job search, aiming to find a part-time position that would provide a stable foundation as I pursued my career aspirations. I landed a role as a front desk agent at a local hotel near my hometown which helped me support myself during this transitional period.</p>
                <p>While working as a front desk agent, I had the opportunity to explore my interest in web development further. It was during this time that I undertook an internship as a press release writer for an online resource dedicated to workplace rights. This experience served as a catalyst, sparking my passion for web development and reinforcing my desire to transition into this dynamic field. I remember being tasked with small updates to the website while uploading press releases to certain pages. I wanted to learn and understand the workings of web development, so I started taking online courses to improve my front end development skills.</p>
                <p>I vividly recall the application and interview process during which I applied to what felt like countless positions, each one a potential stepping stone toward my dream career. In 2016, my persistent efforts finally paid off when I received an offer from DealerOn. This opportunity marked the beginning of my professional journey in web development. Even though I had not been hired as one yet, I knew that I had what it took to become one.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 mt-2 mb-2">
                <h2><strong>Data Analysis</strong></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>Once I was employed at DealerOn, Inc., I was assigned to my first project involving the audit and management of all the Homenet Inventory products (APIs). The audit consisted of 1,479 inventory products, and through my research, I canceled 185 of them. This specific audit successfully saved the company $66,000 annually. This audit, along with other circumstances, allowed the company to expand its workspace to another suite in the same office building where their headquarters was located. The company then decided to make me the primary agent for all deactivations of the websites that the company provided for dealers internationally. This role allowed me to help the company save more money through product cancellation and management within our content management system, as well as working with third-party product providers.</p>
                <p>The Homenet product audit was assigned to me again at the beginning of 2019, resulting in another $20,000 saved annually. I was then asked to be a part of the massive data reconciliation audit for all the clientele's products and accounts during the company's migration to Salesforce. We initially used JIRA as the primary work management system. The Salesforce migration audit led to the company hiring two new members for the team I was helping to form, the Technology and Business Operations team. I assisted in training these new hires in their day-to-day tasks, as well as the deactivation of dealers' sites.</p>
                <p>I was then taksed with the setup and implementation of the new knowledge base. For this project, I have designed cross-departmental templates for the creation of articles within the space. I also established the process for how an employee would request to create articles through the knowledge base. In addition, I conducted research on the Atlassian knowledge base platform, Confluence, and presented my findings to executives to assist in their decision on which system to use in the future. I created a company-wide questionnaire using Excel workbooks to collect data for the knowledge base creation and the migration of previously created articles. Leading up to the migration to Salesforce, I organized and conducted meetings with multiple departments within the company to advance the project towards completion.</p>

                <h2><strong>Web Design</strong></h2>
                <hr>
                <p>After the completion of this project, I applied to an opening in the Design department and was accepted to take on the role of web designer. This position has a generic title, but the work is primarily that of a front end web developer. This was where I wanted to be in my career and I was extremely happy to be given the opportunity.</p>
